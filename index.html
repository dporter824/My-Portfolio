                        <p>
                            Hello and welcome to my first webpage built from scratch
                            with nothing but a project sample to go off. I am new to
                            the development world and am learning front end development
                            before I continue down my learning path.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My end goals for development is to become a full stack 
                            developer specializing in Javascript and PHP. I currently
                            work in a job where I have access to the companies full
                            code repository and have already made some changes and 
                            fixes!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been learning through Codeacademy for <span id="calc-time"></span> days.
                            Codeacademy has been a great tool for learning how to 
                            program and I'm very happy with how far I've come in <span id="calc-time1"></span> days!
                            My personal goals for programming is to one day code and
                            design my own indie game!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I am not learning to code, I love playing video games
                            and spending time with my dogs and wife. My passion is 
                            video game development and hope to be able to contribute
                            my own creations to the indie game scene.
                        </p>
